## Background
--- 
Heard is an application that aims to foster a safe, anonymous community of secret sharers and secret bearers. Users can choose to share a confession or start a message thread about a specific topic. The application design takes a mobile-focused approach as most of the interactions will likely take place sporadically throughout the day on an accessible device. 


## Features 
---
### User Authentication - Login/Signup 

Heard features a fully functional user authentication system, complete with a demo user login and error handling for incomplete entries. Upon successful login, the user will be redirected to a home page where the user can choose to participate in the application as a listener or create confessions or message threads.
